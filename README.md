# CloudburstDataViz
React app that visualizes weather data (specifically on days of cloudbursts)

## How to run
Type npm run dev in console

## How to use your own data
To use your own data, export it into a csv format and paste it in the data folder (public/data)
then either rename it as data1.csv or replace the name in /src/chart.tsx

## If all goes well, your website should show this
